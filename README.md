## ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Gio

I am a fullstack software engineer with over nine years of professional experience.
This GitHub page is where I post fun projects that tend to center around my hobbies.


Feel free to [check out my blog](https://gioarc.me/) for interesting posts that cover the code I write!

### What's with the elephant?
I focus on web technologies such as PHP. Over the years I've collected a few [ElePHPants](https://www.php.net/elephpant.php). The one pictured is a _Laravel_ elephant!
